The basic programming concepts in OOP are:

    1. Abstraction
    2. Polymorphism
    3. Encapsulation
    4. Inheritance
    
    
    Objects: Objects are basic building blocks of a PHP OOP program. An object is a combination of data and methods. In a OOP program, we create objects. These objects communicate together through methods. Each object can receive messages, send messages, and process data.

    There are two steps in creating an object. First, we create a class. A class is a template for an object. It is a blueprint which describes the state and behavior that the objects of the class all share. A class can be used to create many objects. Objects created at runtime from a class are called instances of that particular class.
